   We mentioned that epoll tracks state changes of FDs,\\
   epoll could work under two modes,
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Edge-Triggered {\scriptsize notify only when an FD changes from not ready to ready}\\
   {\footnotesize e.g., won't notify again if you don't empty the buffer first }
   \item Level-Triggered {\scriptsize notify whenever an FD is ready}\\
   {\footnotesize e.g., will always notify if there is data in the buffer }
   \end{itemize}
   
   epoll works under LT mode by default,\\this is how you could change it to ET,
   \begin{lstlisting}[language=C++,basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,commentstyle=\color{commgreen},keywordstyle=\color{blue},breaklines=true]
struct epoll_event ev;
ev.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLET;
ev.data.fd = sockfd;
if (epoll_ctl(epfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, sockfd, &ev) < 0) {
  /* handle epoll_ctl error here */
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
